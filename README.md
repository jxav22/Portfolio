## FAQ

#### It's a portfolio isnt it, where are the projects?
The portfolio itself is the project

In all seriousness, i've tried to incorporate my main projects into this portfolio. There's a few to explore, including snake and the command prompt terminal. I plan to include the rest in a list somewhere - maybe as the output of a PROJECTS command.

Although, since you are here already, feel free to check out my github for a few more cool projects!

#### There's something missing/something I don't like

Please tell me! You can find my contact details through the CONTACT command in the terminal, or alternatively through hitting the email button.

#### I want to hire you, immediately

I'm glad you want to hire me immediately. I guess the real question is, what do you want to hire me for??

Regardless, please notify me through the CONTACT command -
I'm always ready for an opportunity!

#### Couldn't I just look through the project code, discover all the easter eggs and claim the grand prize for myself?

I mean you could 

But maybe I want you to do that, maybe it's all a con to get you to check through my code 

Doesn't feel so scandalous now does it

#### If I ask you question, assuming i'm the only person who asked a question, wouldn't that count as a frequently asked question and hence be qualified to be put on this section of the README?

Hey, that's a great idea! Go ahead, ask me a question
